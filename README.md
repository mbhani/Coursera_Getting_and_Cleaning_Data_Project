This is a repository that has the course project data sets and R script file and detail documentation of the project deliverables and goals. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, message and clean, post process raw data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data set that can be used for later analysis by others.

The R script “run_analysis.R” that is part of this repository does all the sorting and merging and extracting of the tidy dataset, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio to run the script. 

At the end of running the script it will output in your local directory three data text files generated as a result of script execution, these text files are:

* extracted_data2.txt
* melteddata.txt
* tidydata.txt
